## 💡 What is *Sister*?

**Sister** is a minimalist webpage crafted as a personal or emotional tribute — perhaps to a real sister, a best friend, or someone special. Built with core web technologies and no heavy frameworks, it loads fast and works everywhere.

Think of it as a **digital postcard** — a creative expression packed into clean code.

## ❤️ Why I Made This

Because sometimes, **code speaks emotions**. This was a creative way to:

* Say something meaningful using HTML/CSS
* Practice frontend web design
* Explore minimal design aesthetics

It’s not just about writing lines of code — it’s about **creating moments**.
